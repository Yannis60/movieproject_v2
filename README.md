The Movie Ratings Project is a Java-based application that lets users search, view, and analyze movie ratings through an interactive GUI.
It connects to a MySQL database to retrieve movie details, calculate average ratings, and display rating counts in real time.
Users can enter any movie title, browse results, and explore data in a simple and intuitive interface. 
This project showcases Java GUI development, SQL integration, and basic data analytics, making it a solid foundation for future features such as recommendations, filtering, and user-generated ratings.
